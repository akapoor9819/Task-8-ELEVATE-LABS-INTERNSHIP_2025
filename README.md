# Super Store Sales Dashboard

### This Power BI dashboard gives a summary of sales, profit, and sales trends for a superstore.
### I built it to quickly show key metrics and help understand what is driving performance.

# Whatâ€™s inside
## Sales and Profit:
- The dashboard shows the total sales (2.30 million) and total profit (286.4K).
- This helps understand how much money the company is earning and keeping as profit.

## Sales by Region:
- Sales are highest in the West, followed by East.
- Central and South regions have lower sales, showing areas for improvement.

## Sales by Category:
- Technology products have the highest sales (36.4%), then Furniture (32.3%), and Office Supplies (31.3%).
- Technology is the strongest sales category right now.

## Monthly Sales Trend:
- Sales go up and down each month.
- March, September, November, and December have the highest sales.
- The company should see what works well in those months and try to repeat it.

# How I made it
### I used Power BI to create this dashboard using sales data.
### Visuals include bar charts for regions, donut charts for categories, and a line chart for sales trends over months.

# What to do next
- Focus on Central and South regions to increase sales there.

## Check why sales are high in some months and apply those actions elsewhere.

## Keep tracking category performance for growth.
